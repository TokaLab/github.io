# About VirtualLab

**VirtualLab (Virtual Laboratory)** is a flexible framework that allows users to integrate their own simulation modules and build customized tokamak models.

VirtualLab provides a modular environment where different components—such as plasma equilibrium solvers, diagnostics, and control systems—can be connected and combined to create a comprehensive virtual tokamak experiment.

To help users get started, we include a variety of example modules demonstrating common use cases and integration workflows.

This approach empowers researchers to prototype, test, and validate new ideas and algorithms within a unified and adaptable simulation platform tailored to their specific needs.
