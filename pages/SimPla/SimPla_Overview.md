# About SimPla

**SimPla (Simulated Plasma)** is a module designed to reconstruct plasma equilibrium given a target separatrix and various hyperparameters. It enables detailed modelling of tokamak plasma behaviour through a structured and modular approach.

The module is written in both MATLAB and Python. Moreover, a MATLAB non-object oriented version, usefull for students working for the first time with MATLAB, can be found [here](/SimPla_edu/). 

The module is composed of three main classes:

- **Tokamak**: Handles tokamak-specific information and parameters essential for simulation.
- **Geometry**: Prepares and manages the geometric configurations necessary for equilibrium calculations.
- **Equilibrium**: Contains all methods and variables required to compute and analyse the plasma equilibrium.

Moreover, SimPla uses other classes automatically uploaded in the **equilibrium** one, descrubed in **SimPla - Other Classes**.

Together, these classes provide a comprehensive framework to simulate and study plasma equilibria in tokamak devices.
