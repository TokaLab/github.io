## Class: `equilibrium`

The `equilibrium` class is responsible for computing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium solutions based on the Grad–Shafranov equation, and for extracting critical physics profiles and geometric structures from the result.

### Purpose

This class defines and solves the axisymmetric equilibrium of a tokamak, including:
- Construction of the poloidal magnetic flux (`ψ`)
- Extraction of the magnetic field and current components
- Identification of O- and X-points
- Post-processing of the Last Closed Flux Surface (LCFS)
- Evaluation of pressure, magnetic (`F²`) and kinetic profiles

### Methods

#### `import_configuration(geo, config)`
Sets up the geometry and configuration for the equilibrium solver, and initializes default solver parameters.

#### `import_classes()`
Imports all required helper classes used in solving the equilibrium.

#### `solve_equilibrium(psi)`
Solves the Grad–Shafranov equation either from a first guess or a given initial `ψ`.

- Iteratively updates the solution using the toroidal current and Grad–Shafranov operator.
- Applies separatrix and boundary conditions.
- Tracks convergence and visualizes iteration progress.

#### `compute_profiles()`
Computes the full set of physics quantities after equilibrium solution:

- Evaluates `p`, `F²`, `Bt`, `Br`, `Bz`, `Jr`, `Jz`
- Computes kinetic quantities: `ne`, `ni`, `Te`, `Ti`, `pe`, `pi`

#### `CriticalPoints(Ip, R, inside_wall, Psi)`
Detects the O- and X-points by locating extrema in the `ψ` gradient within the domain bounded by the wall.

Returns:
- `Opoint`: Index of magnetic axis
- `Xpoint`: Index of the X-point

#### `equi_pp()`
Post-processes the final solution:

- Interpolates to high-resolution grid
- Recomputes O/X-points
- Re-normalizes `ψ` (`ψ_n`)
- Identifies the Last Closed Flux Surface (LCFS)
