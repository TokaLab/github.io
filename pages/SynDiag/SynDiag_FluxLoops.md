# `Diag_FluxLoops` Class

The `Diag_FluxLoops` class simulates measurements from flux loops, which are used in tokamak diagnostics to measure the local poloidal magnetic flux at specific locations within the vessel.

---

## Properties

- **R**, **Z**: Horizontal and vertical coordinates indicating the positions of the flux loops.
- **psi**: Measured poloidal flux at the specified location, including simulated noise.
- **ideal**: Structure storing the ideal (noise-free) flux measurement.
- **unit**: Unit of the flux measurement, typically `"Wb/rad"` (Weber per radian).
- **config**: Configuration structure containing parameters for simulated noise and diagnostic setup.

---

## Methods

### `measure(equi)`
Simulates the measurement of the poloidal magnetic flux at specified coordinates.

- Interpolates the magnetic flux (`psi`) from the equilibrium data at the defined diagnostic locations.
- Stores the noise-free value in `ideal.psi`.
- Adds noise to simulate measurement uncertainty:
  - **Absolute noise**: Drawn from a normal distribution with a constant standard deviation.
  - **Proportional noise**: Based on the magnitude of the signal, scaled accordingly.
- The resulting noisy measurement is stored in `psi`.

### `Upload(configuration)`
Loads predefined positions and noise configurations for the flux loops.

- If no configuration is provided, defaults to configuration `1`.
- Loads coordinates and other parameters from an external `.mat` file (e.g., `FluxLoopsData_config_1.mat`).
- Initializes the noise characteristics.

## Usage Example

```matlab
flux = Diag_FluxLoops();
flux = flux.Upload();            % Load default configuration
flux = flux.measure(equilibrium); % Simulate flux loop measurement
