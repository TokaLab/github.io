# `Diag_ThomsonScattering` Class

The `Diag_ThomsonScattering` class simulates measurements obtained from a Thomson scattering diagnostic, which provides localized values of electron density (`ne`) and electron temperature (`Te`) within a plasma.

---

## Properties

- **R**, **Z**: Horizontal and vertical coordinates of the measurement points.
- **ne**: Measured electron density at the defined positions, including noise.
- **Te**: Measured electron temperature at the defined positions, including noise.
- **ideal**: Structure containing the ideal (noise-free) values of `ne` and `Te`.
- **unit_ne**: Unit for electron density, typically `"m^{-3}"`.
- **unit_Te**: Unit for electron temperature, typically `"eV"`.
- **config**: Structure containing noise configuration and diagnostic setup parameters.

## Methods

### `measure(equi)`
Performs synthetic Thomson scattering measurements using equilibrium data.

- Electron density (`ne`) and temperature (`Te`) are interpolated from the equilibrium grid at the specified diagnostic positions.
- These interpolated values are stored in `ideal.ne` and `ideal.Te`.
- Noise is added to simulate realistic measurements:
  - **Absolute noise**: Added independently of the signal's magnitude.
  - **Proportional noise**: Scales with the signal's value.
- Final values including noise are stored in `ne` and `Te`.

### `Upload(configuration)`
Initializes the diagnostic setup by defining measurement positions and noise parameters.

- If no configuration is specified, defaults to configuration `1`.
- Measurement positions are generated as linear arrays in `R` and `Z`.
- All noise levels (absolute and proportional) are initialized to zero unless specified otherwise.

## Usage Example

```matlab
ts = Diag_ThomsonScattering();
ts = ts.Upload();             % Load default configuration
ts = ts.measure(equilibrium); % Simulate measurement of ne and Te
